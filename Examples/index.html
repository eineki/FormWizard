  <h2 class="title">FormWizard Examples' Gallery</h2>
  <p>In this page there are a bunch of examples, ideally ordered from the simpler to more
     complex ones, useful to start to know how FormWizard is controlled.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 class="title"><a href="01/index.html">Getting Started</a></h2>
  <p>The first example will illustrate the simplest usage of formwizard:
     write a form and let the plugin do the best it can without any
     directive.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <h2 class="title"><a href="02/index.html">Applying simple scripts</a></h2>
  <p>We can script the different pages to obtain a clever wizard. Instead
     of resorting to validate content at the end of the filling process,
     we can check for ill formatted or missing values at the page flip.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 class="title"><a href="03/index.html">Advanced (a bit) scripting</a></h2>
  <p>We can leverage on script to steer the process based on user input.
     In this example we will skip a page if the user state he is vegan.
     In the previous example, we have encontered an annoying FormWizard behaviour
     When an user enter the page in which he have to leave a message, he remain stuck 
     until he don't fill the appropriate field. We have to ease the FormWizard check
     in order to let an user to go back and change some of the fields he filled before
     (in our case the email). 
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 class="title"><a href="04/index.html">Using CSS to style the wizard</a></h2>
  <p>We can apply a custom skin to the wizard just by css styling. Maybe it is just an 
     <em>exercise of style</em> but you can have an hint on what you can obtain by leveraging
     on your css skills.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 class="title"><a href="05/index.html">Advanced CSS styling</a></h2>
  <p>The plugin apply some utility class to the container in order to give to the developer 
     the chance to respond to a user action easily. Let see how it is done in this example.
